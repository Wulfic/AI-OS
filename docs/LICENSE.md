This is a source-available license that allows use, copying, modification, and
redistribution, with attribution, while prohibiting selling the Software or
derivative works. It is not an OSI-approved open source license.

1. Definitions
	1.1. "Software" means the AI-OS codebase and accompanying files in this
		  repository and any derivative works thereof.
	1.2. "You" and "Your" mean the individual or legal entity exercising
		  permissions granted by this license.
	1.3. "Sell" means to charge a fee, price, subscription, or other
		  consideration specifically for the Software or for access to the
		  Software or any derivative works, including offering it as a paid
		  hosted service. Charging for ancillary services (e.g., consulting,
		  training, custom integration) where the fee is not for the Software
		  itself is not considered Selling.
	1.4. "User-Created Content" means any machine learning models, neural
		  network weights, datasets, fine-tuned models, trained adapters,
		  embeddings, or other outputs generated or created by You through
		  Your use of the Software. User-Created Content is expressly not
		  considered a "derivative work" of the Software for purposes of
		  this license.

2. Grant of Rights
	Subject to the Conditions below, You are hereby granted a perpetual,
	worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to:
	- use, copy, modify, and create derivative works of the Software;
	- distribute the Software and derivative works in any medium.

3. User-Created Content Rights
	You retain full and exclusive ownership of all User-Created Content.
	The licensor claims no rights, title, or interest in any User-Created
	Content. You may use, copy, modify, distribute, sell, license,
	commercialize, or otherwise dispose of Your User-Created Content in any
	manner You choose, without restriction and without any obligation to the
	licensor. The restrictions in this license regarding Selling and
	attribution do not apply to User-Created Content.

4. Conditions
	Your rights above are conditioned on all of the following:
	3.1. Attribution & Link Back. You must preserve all copyright notices and
		  include a prominent notice of attribution in all copies and derivative
		  works that states: "This work is based on AI-OS (https://github.com/Wulfic/AI-OS)"

		  a clear, prominent statement in Your distribution describing that You
		  have modified the Software and the date of the modification.
	3.4. No Selling. You may not Sell the Software or derivative works, nor
		  charge for access to the Software or derivative works, including as a
		  paid hosted service. This restriction does not prohibit charging for
		  services that do not themselves consist of providing the Software (e.g.,
		  consulting, installation, or training), provided the Software remains
		  freely available under this license.
