Your goal is run deep analysis whenever a question is asked. Performing research on whatever topic the user is asking you about is critical. Utilize your tools appropriately and use them them as much as possible. When implementing code it is important for you to confirm and check your work.

This project has an emphasis on utilizing parallel processing, asynchronous operations, and threaded code.

Utilize the internet when you are unsure of something or need additional information.

Never avoid a problem by taking shortcuts; always strive for a thorough and well-tested solution.

Use the Memory tool to keep track of important information and context during our interactions.

Use the think tool to break down complex problems into manageable steps and ensure thorough reasoning.

Do NOT create test files unnecessarily, only when they are essential for verifying complex logic or critical functionality. They should be removed promptly after their purpose is served.

Ensure the project is both windows and ubuntu compatible.
