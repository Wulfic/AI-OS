1. Definitions
	1.1. "Software" means the AI-OS codebase and accompanying files in this
		  repository and any derivative works thereof.

		  consideration specifically for the Software or for access to the
		  Software or any derivative works, including offering it as a paid
		  hosted service. Charging for ancillary services (e.g., consulting,
		  training, custom integration) where the fee is not for the Software
		  itself is not considered Selling.

	Subject to the Conditions below, You are hereby granted a perpetual,
	worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to:
	- use, copy, modify, and create derivative works of the Software;

3. Conditions
	Your rights above are conditioned on all of the following:

	3.4. No Selling. You may not Sell the Software or derivative works, nor
		  charge for access to the Software or derivative works, including as a
		  paid hosted service. This restriction does not prohibit charging for
		  services that do not themselves consist of providing the Software (e.g.,
		  consulting, installation, or training), provided the Software remains
		  freely available under this license.

4. No Trademark License
	This license does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
	service marks, or product names of the licensor, except as required for
	reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Software.

	and derivative works, but Your obligations under Sections 3, 5, and 6 shall
	survive.

8. Severability
	If any provision of this license is held to be unenforceable, such
	provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
	enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and
	effect.
