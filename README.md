## What is AI-OS?

- Today: Train Hierarchical Reasoning Models (HRM) with Sparse Mixture‑of‑Experts (MoE) on consumer GPUs. Optimizations enable long context training on almost any sized card! Designed to be a streamlined, pipeline, from data prep to model training/inference to evaluation for users of all skill levels. No need to be an ML expert to get started!
- Tomorrow: Deeper OS integration and autonomous, idle‑time learning.
- Bleeding edge technologies, pushing the boundaries of consumer hardware.
- Tons more features! Check out the Planned_Features section

Key features in v1.0.0:
- Windows and Ubuntu Support!
- Long-context training strategies and memory optimizations 
- Multi‑GPU training (DDP/Parallel/Sharding)
- GUI + CLI(TUI coming soon!)
- End to End pipeline for HRM based models
- Integration with huggingface
- (Optional) Base model with extremely basic english comprehension

## Authors Note
While the minimum specs listed below will allow you to train and run models, please bare in mind, that training could take weeks on smaller/older cards.
The Optional model that ships alongside this program was trained on 2x RTX 2080ti(11GB) cards. The model is a utilizing the qwen tokenizer, sMoE enabled 268M Params with 8 experts, context length of 1024 resulting in about ~6000 characters for output. Trained 1/10th the Tiny Stories Dataset in ~6 hours.

TLDR; Have a fast ass GPU with lots of VRAM if you're impatient.

## Minimum Recommended Specs!
- GPU: 6GB VRAM **NOTE** (Nvidia:Full Support|AMD:UNTESTED|INTEL(ARC):UNTESTED|CPU:Partial Support)
- System Memory: 16GB
- CPU: 4 Core

### Prerequisites
- ~8-10GB Storage for the program, however having at a least a 1 TB SSD/NVME is ideal!
- Windows 11 or Ubuntu 24
- Internet connection(Faster is better)
*Note*: If you have a metered connection(limited monthly bandwidth), be mindful of the datasets you choose.

## Quick Install Info
### Installers
Find the official installers also in the [Releases section](https://github.com/Wulfic/AI-OS/releases).
See [installers/README.md](installers/README.md) for Windows (.exe) and Ubuntu (.deb) info.
If you broke your install or are missing dependencies in terminal use: 
```bash
aios doctor --repair
```
### APT
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wulfic/ppa-aios
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ai-os -y
```
### Ubuntu
```bash
# From repo root
sudo chmod a+x ./installers/scripts/install_aios_on_ubuntu.sh
sudo ./installers/scripts/install_aios_on_ubuntu.sh install --yes
```
### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# From repo root(might need to run as admin)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
./installers/scripts/install_aios_on_windows.ps1 -Action install -Yes
```

## Administrator Privileges
AI-OS requires Administrator privileges on Windows to function correctly. This is necessary for:
- Write access to `%ProgramData%` for shared artifacts and models.
- GPU scheduling and performance tuning.
- System-level integration features.

The installer creates shortcuts that automatically request elevation. If you launch AI-OS manually, please ensure you run it as Administrator.

## Usage
Use the shortcut to start the program or via terminal.

GUI (recommended):
```
aios gui
```
Interactive CLI:
```
aios
```
